## How to Use

Pressing middle C on a MIDI keyboard, or clicking the C3 key on the Kontakt keyboard below the Wood Wind UI, will play the wind recordings at their recorded pitch and speed. 

Using the modulation wheel on a MIDI keyboard, or the Strength knob on the instrument's UI, will alter the intensity of the wind. 

Using keys lower than middle C will play back the samples at a lower pitch and speed. Using keys higher than middle C will play back the samples at a higher pitch and speed. This allows you to achieve different flavours of wind, using the same samples. The samples start to fall apart at more extreme pitch shifting, but may still be useful for experimental uses.


## Background

The recordings were made in the forest on the slopes of Kitayokodake, an active volcano in Nagano prefecture, Japan, during a residency with Terry Riley. 

The recording setup was left in a tree for 24 hours, enabling it to capture undisturbed wildlife. The 24 hour recording contains lots of material, only a tiny fraction of which has been used in this sample instrument.
